        \item Imperative
        \item Functional style is easily doable!

        \item<1-1> Beautiful is better than ugly.
        \item<1-2> Explicit is better than implicit.
        \item<1-2> Simple is better than complex.
        \item<1-1> Complex is better than complicated.
        \item<1-1> Flat is better than nested.
        \item<1-1> Sparse is better than dense.
        \item<1-2> Readability counts.
        \item<1-1> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
        \item<1-1> Although practicality beats purity.
        \item<1-1> Errors should never pass silently.
        \item<1-1> Unless explicitly silenced.
        \item<1-1> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
        \item<1-2> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
        \item<1-1> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
        \item<1-1> Now is better than never.
        \item<1-1> Although never is often better than \emph{right} now.
        \item<1-2> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
        \item<1-1> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
        \item<1-2> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
